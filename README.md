# Automatic Generation of a Real-Time Task Model for DNNs
This is a R&D project developed in a Master's internship in LIGM Laboratory in ESIEE school located in the suburbs of Paris.

This project aims to geenrate a task model in XML format which contains the characteristics of an Object detetction DNN excuted on any Nvidia GPU architecture.

The alogorithm collects the necessary data from the GPU used, the DNN used, and the specifications of the real-time system, then stacks them up in an .xml file in an organised way allowing the file to be used in real-time scheduling tool "Cheddar".
